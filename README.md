## 🧩 Overview  
Online reviews drive decisions — but **many are fake**.  
**FakeReviewNet** is a deep learning model that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Dense Neural Networks (DNNs)** to identify deceptive reviews.  

It reads a review’s language, tone, and structure — and predicts whether it’s **✅ Genuine** or **🚫 Fake**.  
This is not your typical sentiment analysis; it’s **truth detection through language intelligence**.
